## Features

- Complete API R client with user friendly API in object-oriented fashion with user friendly printing, support operation on users, billing, project, file, app, task etc, short example.

```r
## get project
p = a$project("demo")
## detele files from a project
p$file("sample.tz")$delete()
## upload fies from a folder to a project with metadata
p$upload("folder_path", metadata = list(platform = "Illumina"))
```

- CWL Tool interface, you can directly describe your tool in R, export to JSON/YAML, or add it to your online project. This package defines a complete set of CWL object.

- Task monitoring hook allow you to add hook function to task status when you monitor a task, for example, when task is finished sent you email or download all files.

- Cross platform support from Seven Bridges, such as [NCI Cancer Genomics Cloud](https://www.cancergenomicscloud.org/) or [Seven Bridges](https://www.sbgenomics.com/) on Google and AWS, you can use it.

- Authentification management for multiple platforms/users via config file.

## FAQ

The best place to ask a question about the sevenbridges package is the [Bioconductor support website](https://support.bioconductor.org/). Visit the website and tag your post with the package name __sevenbridges__.

- __Q__: Does this package support Seven Bridge's API v1 which was not cwl compatible?<br />
  __A__: No. This package only supports API v2 +. For API v1, please check out the [sbgr](https://github.com/road2stat/sbgr) package. Note that API v1 and associated legacy project types will be deprecated.

- __Q__: Which version of the Common Workflow Language (CWL) is supported? <br />
  __A__: We support draft 2 and are making progress on supporting draft 3.

- __Q__: Is there a Python binding for the API? <br />
  __A__: Yes, the official Python client is [here](https://github.com/sbg/sevenbridges-python). Recipes and tutorials using the Python bindings are [here](https://github.com/sbg/okAPI).

- __Q__: Why do I get warning messages when I use the API R client?<br />
  __A__: The warning only exists in Rstudio and is potentially a bug in Rstudio. To ignore, it use `options(warn = -1)`

- __Q__: I still have problems despite dismissing the messages.
  __A__: Please try to use the latest package on GitHub or update your package on Bioconductor. This usually includes the most recent bug fixes.
